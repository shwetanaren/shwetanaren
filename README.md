### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shweta

My journey into coding/programming began since diving into building fun projects using 'scratch programming'with my 7 yo old son. This after wearing multiple roles as a UX consultant and GRC/Fraud consultant to managing a customer communication for 10 M+ users.

At this point in time I'm building out projects across the below programming languages / tools. 

- Python Programming & Data Science Technologies
- JAMStack technologies

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to make better decisions with data and design thinking
