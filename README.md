### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shweta

My journey into coding/programming started with C and C++ a decade ago and recently got back into building fun projects using 'scratch programming' with my 7 yo old son and shifted gears to pivot to python and JS. 

At this point in time I'm enjoying building out projects across the below programming languages / tools. 

- Python Programming & Data Science technologies
- JAMStack technologies

ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about how to make better decisions with data and design.
